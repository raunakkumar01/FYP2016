A Java Based Application Framework for Conversion of BASIC Program into 8085 Assembly Program(BASICto8085)


BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a general-purpose
user friendly high-level programming language which is very easy to use.
BASIC was designed specifically for less technical users who did not have or
want the mathematical background previously expected. It is the most popular
programming language among general purpose high level languages. BASIC
remains popular in many dialects and in new languages influenced by BASIC,
such as Microsoft's Visual Basic.


The Intel 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor produced by Intel and introduced in
1976.It is software-binary compatible with the more-famous Intel 8080 with only
two minor instructions added to support its added interrupt and serial input/output
features. However, it requires less support circuitry, allowing simpler and less
expensive microcomputer systems to be built.


BASIC programmiming language is a very friendly high level language which
has very basic syntax which resemble English language. We need an operating
system to compile and run BASIC program. On the contrary, 8085 is a low level
language not easily understandable by users and it needs 8085 microcontroller to
operate. But it is has an inherent advantage that it is faster than high level
languages. So , we needed some framework which can give us 8085 assembly
level programs on entering BASIC program. Hence, we designed BASICto8085
which converts BASIC program to 8085 Assembly Program
